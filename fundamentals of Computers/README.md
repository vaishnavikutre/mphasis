Computer is an electronic device that receives input,stores or processes the input as per user instructions 
and provides output in desired format.

Input-> Process ->Output
Simplest Workflow of Computer

>Computer input is called data 
>Output obtained after processing data,based on user's instructions is called information.
>Raw facts and figures which can be processed using arithmetic and logical operations to obtain information are
called data.
>Processes that can be applied to data are of two types:
 Arithmetic operations
 Logical operations

# The basic parts of computer are:
1. Input Unit:Devices used to input data and instructions
2. Output Unit:Devices used to provide information to the user in desired format
3. Control Unit:All devices or parts of computer interact through the control unit.
4. Arithmetic Logic Unit:All arithmetic operations and logical operations take place.
5. Memory:All input data,instructions and data interim to the
   processes are stored in the memory.Memory is of two types
    ✔ Primary memory
    ✓Secondary memory.

>Control unit,arithmetic logic unit and memory are together called the central processing unit or CPU.
>Computer devices that we can see and touch are the hardware components ofacomputer.
>Set of instructions or programs that make the computer function using these hardware parts are called software.

# Characteristics of Computer
1. Speed:Typicallyacomputer can carry out 3-4 million
instructions per second
2. Accuracy:Computers exhibitavery high degree of accuracy.
Errors that may occur are usually due to human errors
3. Reliability:Computers can carry out same type of work
repeatedly without throwing up errors due to tiredness or
boredom
4. Versatility:Computers can carry outawide range of work
5. Storage Capacity:Computers can storeavery large amount
of data atafraction of cost of traditional storage of files

# Some disadvantages of computers:
  Computers have no intelligence
  Regular electric supply is necessary to make computers work
  Trained people required to work on computers
  
 # Booting 
 Startingacomputer oracomputer-embedded device is called booting.
•Booting steps:
     1. Switching on power supply
     2. Loading operating system into computer's main
     memory
 ## Keeping all applications inastate of readiness in case needed by the user
>The first program or set of instructions that run when the
computer is switched on is called BIOS or Basic Input Output
System.
>BIOS is a firmware

## Restartingasystem when it is already running is rebooting
Rebooting may be required if
- Asoftware or hardware has been installed
- System is unusually slow.
## Two types of booting:
   - Cold Booting:System is started by switching on the
      power supply.The next step in cold booting is loading
      of BIOS.
   -  Warm Booting:When the system is already running
      and needs to be restarted or rebooted,it is called
      warm booting.
      
**Warm booting is faster than cold booting**

## Classification of Computers
All modern computers and computing devices use microprocessors
>Microprocessor speeds and storage capacities are skyrocketing day by day.
>The developmental benchmark for computers is their size.
## Computers are classified on the basis of their use or size:
   - Desktop
   - Laptop
   - Tablet
   - Server
   - Mainframe
   - Supercomputer

## Desktop
- Personal computers(PCs)designed for use by an individual at
afixed location
- IBM was the first company to introduce and popularize use of
desktops
- A desktop unit has
  - CPU(Central Processing Unit)
  - Monitor
  - Keyboard
  - Mouse.

## laptop
- Compact and portable personal computer introduced in 2000s.
- Also called notebook computers or simply notebooks.
- Laptops run using batteries and connect to networks using Wi-Fi chips.
- Chips for energy efficiency
- Enough processing power and storage capacity to be used for
- all office work,website designing,software development and even audio/video editing.

## Tablet
- Small enough to be held in one's palm.
- Processing power ofadesktop
- Touch sensitive screen of typically5to 10 inches
- Keyboard is also displayed virtually whenever required and used with touch strokes.
- Applications that run on tablets are called apps.
- Operating systems provided by Microsoft(Windows8and later versions)or Google(Android)
- Apple computers have their own tablet called iPad which uses aproprietary OS called iOS.

## SuperComputer
- Fastest computers on Earth Used for carrying out complex,fast and time intensive calculations for scientific and engineering applications.
- Speed or performance is measured in teraflops,i.e. 10¹2 floating point operations per second.
- Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight is the world's fastest supercomputer witharating of 93 petaflops per second,i.e. 93 quadrillion floating point operations per  second.
- Most common uses of supercomputers include:
  - Molecular mapping and research
  - Weather forecasting
  - Environmental research
  - Oil and gas exploration
